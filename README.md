# life-calendar

With `life-calendar`, you can view your lifetime at a glance - seeing it anywhere from days to decades. These timeframes will be represented by buttons, which you can color-code, annotate, and edit with Markdown to show your goals and achievements.

The goal of `life-calendar` is, and always has been, to serve as a means to help people grow more productive and utilize their time better. So many hours have been lost on fruitless endeavours, and this project will help users view how (or if) they have progressed in life - by setting themselves goals and writing down what has been accomplished.

## Features

- View your life in days, weeks, months, years, and decades

- Use Markdown to write what you've accomplished or plan to accomplish in each box and have it securely stored

- Login and don't worry about losing any data or having to re-input your details

- Shade boxes (even multiple times!) to demonstrate eras of your lifetime

## Last Note

This project has been inspired by [this post](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) on [waitbutwhy.com](http://www.waitbutwhy.com), which demonstrated a simple, printable calendar of an average life in weeks.
