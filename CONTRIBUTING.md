# Contributing

## What should I contribute?

If you head over to the [the todo part of the README page](https://www.github.com/Destaq/life-calendar#todo), you can see what is next for Life Calendar. Each feature has some tags describing its difficulty, implementation, and community support, and bugs clearly state what issues there are.

## Issues

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent?

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.


### Is it of good quality?

* There are no spelling mistakes
* It reads well
* For English language contributions: Has a good score on [Grammarly](grammarly.com) or [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)
