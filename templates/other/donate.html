    <center><h1>Donation</h1></center>
    <p>Because we keep the site absolutely free, there are some overhead costs that cannot be covered by the application
        itself. Hosting, the domain name, and all the other technical magic that keeps this site online and catering to
        its users doesn't pay for itself, so donations are very welcome. <strong>If you enjoy using the site, please
            consider giving back here.</strong></p>
    <p>If you'd like to financially support this project, there are couple ways in which you can do so. First of all, as
        this project is open-source and freely available on GitHub, you can head over to the GitHub page and sponsor the
        project <a href="https://www.github.com/Destaq/life-calendar">there</a>.</p>
    <p>You can also donate one-time or in recurring monthly donations below with PayPal. Your donations help keep the site going.</p>

    <p>We'll be transparent. The costs are outlined below: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heroku hosting - the app runs remotely on a Heroku dyno, 24/7.</li>
        <li>Heroku Postgres database - we go one step beyond by implementing user functionality and cross-devices logins. Running a Heroku database of the size needed for all the user info costs money.</li>
        <li>Domain name - domain names are cheap, but not free. We have a custom domain name to help reach more people and educate them about their lives.</li>
        <li>Custom email address - sadly, this does not come with the domain. To send emails from <code>info@lifecalendar.com</code> we need to pay as well.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you, or an entity, chooses to donate, you will also have your name below and on the repository as a small means of thanks.</p>
