                    Life Calendar is helpful by providing a minimal, yet aesthetic and clear place to see your life's
                    direction. By tracking what you've done over periods of your life, I firmly believe that it is
                    beneficial by encouraging you to <em>make use of the time you have</em>. Likewise, you can see how
                    you've progressed in hobbies or aspects of your life over time, stay accountable by creating goals
                    for yourself, and use it as your personal diary.

                    No, you do not need an account to be able to use Life Calendar. You can still access your life
                    calendar and statistics page. However, all of your information will disappear once your computer

                    While it may good to use an anonymous account for a couple minutes to see how it looks, we highly
                    recommend you register. This will allow you to have your data securely stored with us and you can

                    The ability to color-code buttons is one of the most critical features of Life Calendar. You can select a
                    button number on the home page, and then the color to shade/unshade it with, and the button will
                    <em>magically</em> get a stripe (or have it removed) from that color!
                    <br><br>
                    The purpose of this is for you to color various boxes based on key, repeated events that happened
                    throughout your life or things you've done. For example, you could color the life box for that day with a light purple
                    bar if you went out with friends, or dark brown if you were sick.
                    <br><br>
                    I recommend sticking to about a maximum of nine colors per box, because beyond that you won't be
                    able to see the stripes (even though it will be saved to the legend).

                    and a lot more.

                    give the goals title, subtitles, and some text, and then a due date and due time. Although you
                    <em>do not</em> receive an email when the due date expires, you can still shade the goals (in
                    progress, cancelled, etc.) and visually overview all the major goals you've gone through in your
                    life.

                    While most may use Fancy Mode for creating life calendars, there is an option to use Markdown. <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#:~:text=Markdown%20is%20a%20lightweight%20markup,using%20a%20plain%20text%20editor.">Markdown</a>
                    is one of the simplest formatting languages out there yet likewise one of the most popular, without
                    any of the extra fluff. You can create tables, italiczed text, and more simply from monospaced font.
                    <br><br>
                    Examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li>*italicize*</li>
                        <li>**bold**</li>
                        <li>:heart:</li>
                        <li>[google link](https://www.google.com)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    It's completely fine do go on using the Fancy Mode, but if you're a programmer or want to be even
                    more minimalist you can use the Markdown Mode. A great guide can be accessed <a
                        href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/">here</a>.

                    Because of the way that Markdown is built, you might have some trouble moving between it and Fancy
                    Mode - I recommend using only one or the other for each box. Fancy Mode uses dynamically generated
                    HTML and images, which often display as raw when converted to HTML. However, it is safe to move
                    <em>from</em> Markdown <em>to</em> Fancy Mode.

                    Currently, Life Calendar has no plans of coming to mobile - a mobile app is a whole new ball game.
                    However, the website is mobile optimized and you can visit our site just as easily on a mobile web
                    browser.

                    The site does use an application programming interface (API) to handle user box requests. However,
                    it's pretty bare-bones at the moment and most of the routes are protected and require a dedicated
                    login.
                    <br><br>
                    If there is interest in the future, however, we will strongly consider implementing an API to
                    interact with the database. This would bring benefits for tech-savvy users, by allowing them to
                    program integration with Google Calendar, emails, etc.
